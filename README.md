# rgbFFT

This is my undergraduate thesis for my B.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Southern University.

It is a comparative study of two image analysis techniques in the context of detecting real vs ai-generated artwork (RGB vs Fast Fourier Transformations)

As AI image generation becomes growingly more sophisticated, it will become more difficult to differentiate between real and fake artwork. As a proof of concept, I wanted to create a tool that could help ensure fellow art enthusiasts are buying truly handmade pieces.

RGB model is up and running, but development is on hold while I review additional litearture on image classification and representation learning.
